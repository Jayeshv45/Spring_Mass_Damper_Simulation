# Spring_Mass_Damper_Simulation
Simulink Project for Spring-Mass-Damper System

# Spring-Mass-Damper System Simulation

## Project Description
This Simulink project models a spring-mass-damper system with various input types, such as clock, step, ramp, sine wave, or custom functions. The system uses time as the input to the spring-mass equation, and integrates acceleration to find velocity, and velocity to find displacement in real-time. 

The model includes:
- Multiple input types: clock, step, ramp, sine wave, or custom functions.
- Integration blocks to calculate velocity and displacement from acceleration.
- Real-time updating of the spring-mass equation with integrated values.
- Scope to display input, acceleration, velocity, and displacement.

## Features
- Simulates a spring-mass-damper system with various inputs.
- Integrates acceleration to compute velocity and velocity to compute displacement in real-time.
- Displays input, acceleration, velocity, and displacement on a scope.

## Files Included
- `Spring_Mass_Damper_Simulation.slx`: The Simulink model file.
- `README.md`: Project description and details.
- Optional: Additional documentation in the `docs` folder.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Spring_Mass_Damper_Simulation.slx` in MATLAB Simulink.
3. Select the desired input type (clock, step, ramp, sine wave, or custom function).
4. Run the simulation and observe the input, acceleration, velocity, and displacement outputs on the scope.
